Hey Rumyooo, have you ever heard of when block coding started? #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
No, I haven't. When did it start exactly? #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

Block coding started gaining popularity in the early 2000s as a way to make programming more accessible to non-technical users. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
The idea was to use visual blocks that could be snapped together to create programs, #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
rather than requiring users to write code from scratch. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
This made programming more accessible and less intimidating to those who were new to it. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk

That's interesting. Who were some of the pioneers in block coding? #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

One of the earliest examples of block coding is Scratch, which was developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at MIT Media Lab. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
Scratch is still widely used today and has inspired many other block-based programming languages such as this game, Gizmos and Language. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
Another popular block coding platform is Blockly, which was developed by Google and is used in a number of educational and commercial applications. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk

Thanks for the information, Kirk! #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

You're welcome, Rumyooo! Block coding has come a long way since its early days, #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
and it continues to evolve and become even more accessible and user-friendly. #speaker:Kirk #portrait:kirk
