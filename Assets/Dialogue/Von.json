Can you tell me what you think about it? ",{"#":"speaker:Von"},{"#":"portrait:von"},"\n","^I think it's a great way to get started with programming. The blocks make it easier to understand the logic behind coding. ",{"#":"speaker:Rumyooo"},{"#":"portrait:rumyooo"},"\n","^I totally agree! Do you know how block coding can be related to something in the real world? ",{"#":"speaker:Von"},{"#":"portrait:von"},"\n","^Interesting question. Let me think... I think block coding can be related to tilling crops. ",{"#":"speaker:Rumyooo"},{"#":"portrait:rumyooo"},"\n","^Really? How so? ",{"#":"speaker:Von"},{"#":"portrait:von"},"\n","^Well, when you till crops, you break up the soil into smaller, manageable pieces. Similarly, with block coding,","\n","^you break down a problem into smaller, manageable blocks of code that can be easily understood and solved.
