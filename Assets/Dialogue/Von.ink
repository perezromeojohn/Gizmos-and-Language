Hey Rumyooo, have you tried block coding before? #speaker:Von #portrait:von
Yes, I have. I've been doing it for a little while now. #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

Great! Can you tell me what you think about it? #speaker:Von #portrait:von

I think it's a great way to get started with programming. The blocks make it easier to understand the logic behind coding. #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

I totally agree! Do you know how block coding can be related to something in the real world? #speaker:Von #portrait:von

Interesting question. Let me think... I think block coding can be related to tilling crops. #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

Really? How so? #speaker:Von #portrait:von

Well, when you till crops, you break up the soil into smaller, manageable pieces. Similarly, with block coding, 
you break down a problem into smaller, manageable blocks of code that can be easily understood and solved. #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo

That's a great analogy! I've never thought of it that way. Thanks, Rumyooo! #speaker:Von #portrait:von

You're welcome, Von. I'm glad I could help. #speaker:Rumyooo #portrait:rumyooo
